config ECPRI_DMA
	tristate "ECPRI_DMA support"
	depends on NET
	help
	  eCPRI DMA is a programmable direct memory access (DMA) HW block
	  designed to service memory access for eCPRI complex.
	  The driver supports client connection and configuration of the
	  DMA hw block.

	help
	  This framework supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA3) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config EP_PCIE
	bool "PCIe Endpoint mode support"
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

config EP_PCIE_HW
	bool "PCIe Endpoint HW driver"
	depends on EP_PCIE
	help
	  PCIe endpoint HW specific implementation.
	  It supports:
		1. link training with Root Complex.
		2. Address mapping.
		3. Sideband signaling.
		4. Power management.

config MSM_MHI_DEV
	tristate "Modem Device Interface Driver"
	depends on EP_PCIE
	help
	  This kernel module is used to interact with PCIe Root complex
	  supporting MHI protocol. MHI is a data transmission protocol
	  involving communication between a host and a device over shared
	  memory. MHI interacts with the IPA for supporting transfers
	  on the HW accelerated channels between Host and device.
