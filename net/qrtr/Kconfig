config QRTR
	tristate "Qualcomm IPC Router support"
	help
	  Say Y if you intend to use Qualcomm IPC router protocol.  The
	  protocol is used to communicate with services provided by other
	  hardware blocks in the system.

	  In order to do service lookups, a userspace daemon is required to
	  maintain a service listing.

if QRTR

config QRTR_NODE_ID
	int "QRTR Local Node ID"
	default 1
	help
	  This option is used to configure the QRTR Node ID for the local
	  processor. The node ID published to other nodes within the system.
	  This value can be overridden by the name service application. This
	  option is for configurations where Node ID needs to be customized
	  but the name service application is not priveleged enough to use
	  netlink sockets.

config QRTR_WAKEUP_MS
	int "QRTR Wakeup timeout"
	default 0
	help
	  This option is used to configure the wakesource timeout that QRTR
	  should take when a packet is received. The qrtr driver can guarantee
	  that the packet gets queued to the socket but cannot guarantee the
	  client process will get time to run if auto sleep is enabled. This
	  config will help mitigate missed packets on systems where auto sleep
	  is aggressive.

config QRTR_SMD
	tristate "SMD IPC Router channels"
	depends on RPMSG || (COMPILE_TEST && RPMSG=n)
	help
	  Say Y here to support SMD based ipcrouter channels.  SMD is the
	  most common transport for IPC Router.

config QRTR_TUN
	tristate "TUN device for Qualcomm IPC Router"
	help
	  Say Y here to expose a character device that allows user space to
	  implement endpoints of QRTR, for purpose of tunneling data to other
	  hosts or testing purposes.

config QRTR_MHI
	tristate "MHI IPC Router channels"
	depends on MHI_BUS
	help
	  Say Y here to support MHI based ipcrouter channels. MHI is the
	  transport used for communicating to external modems.

config QRTR_MHI_DEV
	tristate "MHI Device IPC Router channels"
	depends on MSM_MHI_DEV || (COMPILE_TEST && MSM_MHI_DEV=n)
	help
	  Say Y here to support MHI base ipcrouter channels for device
	  endpoint mode.  MHI is the transport used for external modem
	  connections.  This driver enables QRTR to run on the modem device
	  side.

config QRTR_GUNYAH
	tristate "Gunyah IPC Router channels"
	help
	  Say Y here to support a fifo based ipcrouter channel with gunyah
	  hypervisor signaling. The gunyah transport layer enables IPC
	  Router communication between two virtual machines. The transport
	  uses dynamically shared memory and gunyah doorbells.

config QRTR_GENPOOL
	tristate "Genpool FIFO IPC Router channels"
	help
	  Say Y here to support a fifo based ipcrouter channel with genpool and
	  IPCC signaling. The genpool fifo transport layer enables IPC Router
	  communication between two endpoints. The transport utilizes a reserved
	  memory created and owned by another device, which is shared through
	  the genpool framework.
